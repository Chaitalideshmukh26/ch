### Usage instructions

Current instructions for installing, as listed on the [Node.js Wiki](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager):

Note that the Node.js packages for EL 5 (RHEL5 and CentOS 5) depend on the [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repository being available. The setup script will check and provide instructions if it is not installed.

Run as root on RHEL, CentOS, CloudLinux or Fedora:

```text
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup | bash -
```

Then install, as root:

```text
yum install -y nodejs
```

***Optional***: install build tools

To compile and install native addons from npm you may also need to install build tools:

```text
yum install gcc-c++ make
# or: yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
```

## Tests

To test an installation is working (and that the setup scripts are working!) use:

```text
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/test | bash -
```
